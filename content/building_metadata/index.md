## Labeled Metadata


The metadata provided is obtained from discovery of points in the BACNet network on our campus. We label the ground truth based on six years of working experience with this Building Management System. We use the naming convention imposed by our university naming schema.

The file format is Microsoft Excel 2007 (xlsx).

* [Bonner Hall](/data/metadata/bonner_sensor_types.xlsx)

* [Biomedical Library](/data/metadata/bonner_sensor_types.xlsx)
* [Applied Physics and Mathematics Building](/data/metadata/bsb_sensor_types.xlsx)

## Raw Metadata

The metadata is crawled from the campus building network.
