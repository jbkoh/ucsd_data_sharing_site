title: Building Timeseries Data
---

We have collected timeseries data for the Computer Science building for over three years and from the rest of the 55 buildings we have access to for a few months. We are making this data available to the community for research. However, we are concerned about the side channel occupant information that may be embedded in the dataset. Thus, we ask you to sign an agreement with us that provides you access to our data for three years and protects the privacy of the building occupants.
